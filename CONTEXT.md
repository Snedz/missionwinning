# CONTEXT.md — boot file (read first, every tool)

One screen of truth for any AI tool or human joining cold. Read this, then [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), then [INDEX.md](INDEX.md). Keep `## Now` current: update it on every ship, in the same commit as the [LOG.md](LOG.md) entry.

## What this is

**Mission Winning** · www.missionwinning.com · "Train Anywhere. Win Daily."

> Adaptive AI coaching for train-anywhere athletes — free offline logging (no account), weekly plans from logs alone (no wearable). Super Bundle adds Coach depth and the other pillars — it never gates the logger.

- Six pillars — Train · Fuel · Move · Mind · Track · Learn — unified by the Mission Score. Constitution: [vision.md](vision.md). Pitch the **Train + Mission Coach wedge**, never "everything app" ([docs/YC_THESIS.md](docs/YC_THESIS.md)). Evidence thesis (structured exercise vs vague advice — not a depression product): [docs/EXERCISE_AS_MEDICINE.md](docs/EXERCISE_AS_MEDICINE.md). Crypto is a **payment rail** (Lifetime USDC), not the product ([docs/CRYPTO_RAILS_THESIS.md](docs/CRYPTO_RAILS_THESIS.md)).
- Surfaces: Next.js 16 PWA (repo root) · native Android Compose ([apps/android](apps/android), v1.24.1) · iOS deferred ([docs/IOS_PLAYBOOK.md](docs/IOS_PLAYBOOK.md)) · "Beyond the Basics" guidebook (`/guide` + magazine PDF).
- Solo founder + AI agents. Founder owns users, money, legal, secrets, `PRIVATE_MODE`. Agents own code, tests, perf, docs — inside horizon gates.

## Now (2026-07-23 · web UX · Android `1.24.1`)

> The ONLY "where we are" block in the repo — [ORCHESTRATION.md](ORCHESTRATION.md) points here.

- **Horizon W — wedge excellence.** Web wedge nav + Log food portal; Welcome/Active/Victory/shell chrome de-templated; free-beta Coach honest.
- **Free-first beta (~4 weeks):** LLC + EIN pending — **no Bundle UI** + **full depth unlocked** ([docs/FREE_BETA.md](docs/FREE_BETA.md)). Fuel copy no longer claims paid Nutrition course.
- **Media system:** Google Flow · Scout mascot — [docs/MEDIA_SYSTEM.md](docs/MEDIA_SYSTEM.md).
- Agents **must** ship wedge habit-loop + free acquisition. Refuse new pillars / America / locale farms / F5.
- **Ops:** keep Supabase Site URL on www. **Founder:** Accept B on Android + phone excellence → invites → YC F26.

## Trap terms (full glossary: AGENTS.md)

| Term | Means |
|------|-------|
| Mission Coach | AI plan engine — `src/lib/coach/`, `/coach` (≠ `/coaching` human-lead form) |
| Today | Route `/log` (`HomePage.tsx`), nav label "Today" |
| Train | Route `/active` — the logger |
| Fuel | Route `/nutrition` |
| Journey phase 0–3 | UX arc ([docs/JOURNEY.md](docs/JOURNEY.md)) ≠ build phases A–I ([docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md)) ≠ PFT G1–G8 |
| Horizon 0–3 | What may be built now — [ORCHESTRATION.md](ORCHESTRATION.md) |
| Wedge | Train + Mission Coach — the go-to-market story |
| Super Bundle | The one premium sub: $11.99/mo · $59/yr founders · $149 lifetime |
| PRIVATE_MODE | Site gate — only the founder flips it |
| mw-core | [packages/mw-core](packages/mw-core) — pure TS shared coach/workout logic |

Android: `cd apps/android && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`.

## Hard rules

1. **Horizon rule** — Horizon W: build wedge excellence (Train/Today/Victory/Coach). No new pillars/locales/America/F5 without explicit founder override. ≥10 beta only after excellence sign-off.
2. **The free logger is never gated. Ever.**
3. Agents never flip `PRIVATE_MODE`, never invent traction numbers, never mark founder tasks done.
4. Do not open stale/deleted paths — [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) §4.
5. Docs match reality: every ship updates [LOG.md](LOG.md) + this file's `## Now` (+ build label).
